This is my first practice thing about react here i came to understand about 
1.why is react single page model
2.i have learnt about hooks
3.how hooks are::{hooks are inbuilt functions in react we just have to use them and they will give some special output here in this basic project is have used the useState hook which will give output inthe form of array [counter,setCounter] useState(0) here 0 is counter as it is starting value }

4.using hooks is simple thing we  just have to call it and then store the output of that function which willl be in array form having one variable and one method in it so when we have to use hooks we give it a default value that deafault value will be then used to update the value of counter which has beed in the output of that array
