This is my first practice thing about react here i came to understand about 
1.why is react single page model
2.i have learnt about hooks
3.how hooks are::{hooks are inbuilt functions in react we just have to use them and they will give some special output here in this basic project is have used the useState hook which will give output inthe form of array [counter,setCounter] useState(0) here 0 is counter as it is starting value }
